Studying for the first week of software developer, making me feeling passionate and curious. Knowing about the knowledge that teacher taught and get to know about software development makes me find out my interest. We learned about building our linkdin page in the first day and we also talk about our passion about the direction of building an application. In the next two days, we studied about github which is the Facebook between programmer, another important thing we learned was how to build ourselves web page using hugo. This is one of the best things I had learned, and I am really looking forward to learn more about programming in the future.
Another thing which I am interested in is how to connect software development between my major in university HVAC. Form my point of view, the usage of software and apps in HVAC is about intelligent building and internet of things. After reading a few articles about these, I realized that there are some blank in this direction, which means it is a great opportunity for students like me to develop software in this territory.
