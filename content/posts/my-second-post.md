Intelligent building

Abstract

An Intelligent Building is a building in which the use of technology and process create a safer and more productive environment for its occupants and more operationally efficient for its owners.

Two main propose of intelligent building

  The first propose of intelligent building is lessen the energy use of buildings. In 2004, in EU, it is recognized that building consumption was documented as 37% of final energy, which on its own is larger than that documented for industrial sectors (28%) and that of transport reaching (32%). Using the intelligent air conditioner system dynamic accommodation controlling the temperature and humidity of the whole building, can change the situation of wasting energy in HVAC system.
  The second propose of intelligent building is realizing IoE (Internet of Everthing), building a smart living environment. As the prototype of IoE, there are a few types of intelligent devices existed in human’s life, for example , intelligent sound equipment and voice assistant are more and more popular in these days. The popularity of theses AI systems show us a direction of how buildings should develop in the future. Connecting with different devices, sharing information among various system through the internet, controlling by the voice system, implanting AI system into furniture are the mainly development in building a smart living environment.

Difficulties and challenges

  Thinking about the difficulties and challenges of developing intelligent building, the first thing I think is about the costing of intelligent devices. In order to realize the machine communication, every kinds of furniture have to implant a system and must improve the performance of the hardware and software. This will increase people’s home cost. The second thing is necessity. Without demand, people would like to change their old homes into a more intelligent one, so as for generalize intelligent building, the most important thing is finding the pain point of people, and improve the whole system of intelligent building.
